### Hackerrank_Recursive Digit Sum
Example
n = '9875'
k = 4 

The number p is created by concatenating the string n k times so the initial p =9875987598759875.

    superDigit(p) = superDigit(9875987598759875)
                  9+8+7+5+9+8+7+5+9+8+7+5+9+8+7+5 = 116
    superDigit(p) = superDigit(116)
                  1+1+6 = 8
    superDigit(p) = superDigit(8)

    All of the digits of p sum to 116. The digits of 116 sum to 8. 8 is only one digit, so it is the super digit.

### interviewbit_Greatest Common Divisor
Given 2 non-negative integers A and B, find gcd(A, B).
GCD of 2 integers m and n is defined as the greatest integer g such that g is a divisor of both m and n.
Both A and B fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

### LeetCode_Word Break
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

Example 1:
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

Example 2:

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
Example 3:

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false
