### LeetCode_Linked List Cycle
Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.


Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

### LeetCode_LRU Cache
Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

Implement the LRUCache class:

LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.
The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input
["LRUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4]

Explanation
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4


### GeeksforGeeks_Linked List Length Even or Odd?
Given a linked list of size N, your task is to complete the function isLengthEvenOrOdd() which contains head of the linked list and check whether the length of linked list is even or odd.

Input:
The input line contains T, denoting the number of testcases. Each testcase contains two lines. the first line contains N(size of the linked list). the second line contains N elements of the linked list separated by space.

Output:
For each testcase in new line, print "even"(without quotes) if the length is even else "odd"(without quotes) if the length is odd.

User Task:
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, you just have to  complete the function isLengthEvenOrOdd() which takes head of the linked list as input parameter and returns 0 if the length of the linked list is even otherwise returns 1.
